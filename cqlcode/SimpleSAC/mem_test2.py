# the variations:
    # a. whether action is random, or from a fixed policy
    # b. whether next state is deterministically decided by s-a, or come from a distribution that is decided by s-a.
    # that gives following possibilities:
    # and then we can also use temperature to control the prob distribution of action and next_state.
    # 1) rand_action - deterministic_next_state (transition)
    # 2) rand_action - stochastic_next_state
    # 3) action depends on state - deterministic next state
    # 4) action depends on state - stochastic next state

    # so I guess we can have an action temperature, and a transition temperature. At an extreme we have totally random.
    # at the other extreme we have deterministic action (depends on state), and deterministic transition (depends on s-a)
    # we can also control the size of the state and action sets.

# and then we have to decide, how do we convert these integers to float values:
    # 1) map each into a learnable embedding
    # 2) map each into a fixed embedding
    #    here we can try, use a random vector, or use a random network to map into a vector
    #    potentially we can also only allow the state to change a bit, so they cannot massively change for each transition...
